                <p>
                    Our Mission is to locate rare and unique dinosaur fossiles and revive them. 
                    To do this we've developed a new generation of dna cloning devices that can take just the bones of dinosaurs and recreate the dna of that dinosaur.
                    You may be thinking that this is going to be really expensive and yes it is, but thats why we've been developing dinosaur parks for massive tourism.
                    With these parks we will be bringing around 300 times the amount we payeed for everything.
                    So Invest Now!

                        We've had the pleasure of procuring some of the best dinosaur fossiles in the world.
                        One such one is the photo above of the 233 million year old dinosaur from brazil.

                            With this new technology we can take the bones of past dinosaurs that you would regularly not be able to get dna from and extract just enough dna to recreate the dinosaur.
                            This new technology has already been patented in most countries worldwide. Which gives us huge headstart to the rest of the world.

                            The Revival of the dinosaurs will be a milestone in humanities technology. It will show that we are no longer restrained by the course of time on reviving anything.

                            With this being the first and only time people have seen real life dinosaurs the tourism is going to be BIG!
                            So much so that were not just building a resort with just a few dinosaurs, but a whole city with thousands of dionsaurs.
                            This won't be cram packed to the brim with people but very open, hardly suffocating and hopefully quite affordable for anyone anywhere.
